              <p>
                Let me tell you a personal story of how I went from having a 9 -
                5 job to being a full time digital marketing consultant.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was March 2018… I was still recovering from my 4th spine
                surgery and was in a whole lot of debt. I had to pay part of the
                debt incurred from my hospital bills and my upcoming house rent.
              </p>
              <p>
                At some point, I was at my wits end. Completely frustrated,
                always in pain and not knowing where to turn to.
              </p>
              <p>
                I had tried applying for foreign jobs but could make no headway
                due to my nationality. I tried applying for some jobs locally
                but ended up turning them down because my surgery scars had
                barely healed, I could not sit down and they did not want staffs
                working remotely.
              </p>
              <p>
                I really needed to clear the hospital debts because I did not
                want my retired parents to start searching for money again.
                Everyone was tapped out from the multiple surgeries…
              </p>
              <p>
                Imagine having the skill to generate income for your business or
                your client.
              </p>
              <p>
                Imagine being able to single-handedly turn your business around
                and start generating leads and sales on autopilot…
              </p>
              <p>
                Imagine having the exact blueprint I used to get my clients
                millions every month in the palm of your hand…
              </p>
              <p>That is the system I would be sharing with you today!</p>

                One major reason businesses fail is because they are not really
                in touch with their customers. These days, you see ads
                everywhere screaming BUY BUY BUY.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through my unique paid traffic system, I discovered how you can
                stand above the noise and reach your target audience and get
                them primed and ready to buy from you.
              </p>
              <p>
                My secret? I discovered how to automate relationship building
                with your customer that would turn your business into a
                continuous money-making machine with Facebook Ads.
              </p>
              <p>
                I can teach you how to use this exact system, just as I have
                helped my clients and my students.

                <p>
                  There are two things that can make or break your Facebook Ads
                  campaign. In this module, I went in depth into the 3 types of
                  audience you can create on Facebook (The third one is a game
                  changer) and all the targeting techniques I use for my clients
                  and teach my students. Forget all those big courses that take
                  months to get through. Even if you’re a brand new beginner,
                  you can follow these strategies to scale your ad with
                  profitable targeting techniques. I even added a targeting
                  technique that works without fail for businesses with physical
                  locations!

                  Everything is spelt out for you in easy-to-understand steps so

                <h3 class="fw-bolder">Module 9 - Optimization</h3>
                <p>
                  What happens after your ads have started running and are
                  profitable? How do you make it better? What tweaks can help
                  you reduce the cost of acquiring a single customer? How can
                  you scale your ads to spend more while still being profitable?
                  All the answers to these and so much more are in this juicy
                  module. I would show you how to figure out which ads need to
                  be optimized, the exact things you need optimized and how to
                  optimize them. You are not just getting theoretical knowledge.
                  I would actually walk you through a live campaign and show you
                  how to optimize!

                WOW!!! It’s so detailed! How long would it take me to go through
                all of these
              </p>

              <p>
                You may be thinking at this moment this is a LOAD of
                information. You’re right. It is. I cover every single element
                you need to run profitable ads. I knew there was a lot to it, so
                I broke it all down into easy bite-sized chunks.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Audience Targeting module is a good example of this. I start
                off with all the beginner techniques you need for getting
                started. Then I expand into the more advanced principles for
                reaching your target audience. If you’re just getting started,
                you may watch the whole module and only apply the 2 or 3 tactics
                to your safe beginner campaign.
              </p>

              <p>
                Later on you’ll come back to that module again as you squeeze
                more and more traffic out of your market… and you drive your
                click-through rates to the bottom of the barrel rates.
              </p>

              <p>
                This is the ONLY product I’ve ever seen with such a depth of
                usable profit enhancers.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you are extremely motivated, you can be done with the entire
                course in a week. It is even possible to finish it in a day,
                though I would never advise that.
              </p>

              <p>
                My recommendation is for you to spend 1 - 2 days per module.
              </p>

              <p>
                I also grouped the course module by module so you can easily
                skip through any module you are already familiar with.
              </p>

              <p>
                You can obviously go through this course at your own pace… but I
                think you’ll be surprised at how fast things start happening as
                soon as you start implementing what I show you.
